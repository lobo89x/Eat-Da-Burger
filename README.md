# Eat-Da-Burger

For this tool I created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. It follows the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML. Version 2.0 will nclude some funky animations as well as a new detail to the data to help me remember if I liked said burger.
